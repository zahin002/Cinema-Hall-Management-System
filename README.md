# 🎬 CINE++
### Cinema Hall Management System

A Feature-Rich File-Based Cinema Hall Management System

CINE++ is a console-based cinema hall management system developed in C++, built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and file-based persistence.

It simulates a real-world cinema ticketing system including booking, pricing, seat management, reviews, and refunds — all without using a database or GUI.
